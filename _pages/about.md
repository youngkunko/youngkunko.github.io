I am Assistant Professor / Faculty Fellow at New York University, hosted by Professor [Oded Regev](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/) and Professor [Subhash Khot](https://cs.nyu.edu/~khot/).

Before this, I spent five years as a PhD student at Princeton University advised by Professor [Mark Braverman](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mbraverm).


Research Interest
------

I am interested in applications of information theoretic techniques in complexity theory.
Currently I am interested in giving data structure lower bounds using techniques from communication complexity.
